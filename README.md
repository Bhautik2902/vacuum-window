# Vacuum window

A vacuum window provides a way to share text content between systems where one system's clipboard is not accessible on another system. It's a web-based application that provides a simpler and faster way to exchange text data that we need to share between our different systems. So, instead of messaging or mailing ourselves, and logging into an unknown system, it is more desirable to have some window which can do this and is accessible from any system which has a web browser installed.
